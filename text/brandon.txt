INSTAGRAM: @brandonsargentt\nBrandon is a writer, an actor, and an occasional vegan based in New York City. He mainly writes personal essays/memoirs, and this is his first time writing for the screen. You may have seen him on Avenue A, drunkenly eating dollar-slice pizza despite his lactose intolerance. When he's not on the set of Hard Feelings, you can find him serving coffees and cocktails to rich Upper East Siders who don't know how to tip.
